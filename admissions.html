    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <div class="banner" id="banner1">
    </div>
    <p>Since the opening of Zion Academy in 1999, the purpose of our school is
      to provide an excellent education and train students in the knowledge of
      our Lord Jesus Christ and instill in them Christian standards and morals.
      The teachers of Zion Academy realize the solemn responsibility before God
      in encouraging a godly life and character of each of their students in
      order to give a good foundation for each child’s future.</p>

    <h2>Our Curriculum</h2>
    <div class="banner" id="banner2">
    </div>
    <p>The A Beka DVD school is used for Zion Academy’s curriculum. Each grade
      and subject is taught from DVD by a master teacher from Pensacola
      Christian Academy, Florida. The A Beka curriculum is highly acclaimed
      among Christian schools and homeschools worldwide.
      <br><br>
    The A Beka Bible curriculum for all grades coupled with the godly
      influence of our teachers and staff are some of the ways Zion Academy
      strives to provide a solid Biblical foundation for its students and to
      assist students in developing a meaningful relationship with the Lord
      Jesus Christ.
      <br><br>
    In addition, Zion Academy provides teachers in our classrooms to aid the
      student with his class work. Classes such as art, music, PE and foreign
      language are taught in the traditional class setting by our own Zion
      Academy teachers.</p>

    <h2>Kindergarten through Grade 12</h2>
  <p>The Kindergarten program focuses on fundamentals, and most students are
    reading successfully by the end of the school year. The A Beka program
    presents students with excellent training in all subjects. As students enter
    the High School grades, they are able to choose classes to prepare them for
    further schooling or vocation after graduation. The Certificate of
    Graduation is awarded to Zion Academy graduates.</p>
